# tradingbot

Creating a simple Python trading bot involves several steps, including connecting to a trading platform's API, implementing a trading strategy, and executing trades. 

I'll use the Alpaca API, which is a popular choice for algorithmic trading. You'll need to sign up for an Alpaca account and obtain your API key and secret key.

If the stock price is above the SMA, the bot will buy shares, and if the stock price is below the SMA, it will sell any existing shares.

You can adjust the trading strategy as needed. 

Note that this bot uses the paper trading API for testing, so no real trades will be executed.  Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and a real trading bot should include additional features such as error handling, logging, and more sophisticated trading strategies.

Additionally, you should thoroughly test any bot before using it with real money.
