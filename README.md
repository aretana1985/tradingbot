# tradingbot

This simple script calculates the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for a specific stock over a specified time period. Although it's not a complete trading bot yet, it can serve as a foundation for further development.

With this script, you can:

    Fetch historical price data for a specific stock (in this case, AAPL) using Alpaca's REST API.
    Choose the timeframe of the historical data (e.g., daily or intraday data).
    Specify the date range for the historical data.
    Calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) over a defined window of periods (e.g., 10 days).

Possible extensions or improvements to turn this into a more functional trading bot could include:

    Implement additional technical indicators such as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to create more complex trading signals.
    Develop a basic trading strategy that generates buy and sell signals based on the calculated SMA (or other technical indicators) and the current stock price.
    Place orders (market, limit, or stop) through Alpaca's REST API based on the generated trading signals.
    Manage a virtual or real portfolio by tracking positions, average purchase price, and unrealized or realized gains/losses.
    Implement risk management techniques such as setting stop-loss or take-profit levels, and adjusting position sizes according to the portfolio's risk profile.
    Schedule the bot to run periodically (e.g., every minute, hour, or day) to continuously update its trading signals, execute orders, and manage the portfolio.

Please note that developing a trading bot carries risks, and any trading strategy should be thoroughly tested and validated using historical data before using it with real money. It is also essential to familiarize yourself with the Alpaca API's documentation, features, and limitations.
